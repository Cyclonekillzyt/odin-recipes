        <h1>Bacon Deviled Eggs</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These deviled eggs with bacon and ranch dressing are easy and tasty. I invented this recipe when I was looking for a new way to make deviled eggs. Week-old eggs peel more easily than fresh eggs. You can use precooked bacon if you like.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 large eggs</li>
            <li>6 slices bacon</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup ranch dressing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place eggs into a large saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Drain. Cool eggs under cold running water. Peel once cold. Halve eggs lengthwise and scoop yolks into a medium bowl. Mash yolks with a fork until smooth.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate; chop once cool.</li>
            <li>Add chopped bacon and ranch dressing to mashed yolks; mix until well combined. Spoon into egg white halves. Arrange on a tray and refrigerate before serving, at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
